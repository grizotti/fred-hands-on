## Task 3. Run the Jenkinsfile and make it successfully finish (DONE)
    - Connect the Jenkins to a git VCS (i.e. GitHub/bitbucket/gitlab 
      all has free account capacity) 
    - Use webhook for each commit push (no polling) 
    - Use jenkins credentials when needed (someone always hacking)

* Update the plugins.
* Have to approve scripts.
* Have to include the "--key-file=deployment/skey" line in all the ansible execution steps .

Step 1 - On Github do the following 
 
Go to github project/settings/webhook/add webhook

Payload URL: http://54.78.87.150:8080/github-webhook/
Content Type: application/jSON
Events: Just the push event
Active.

## Task 4. Run the `deploy_app_to_minikube.yml` playbook development to deploy the `greet` chart with helm to minikube development env (DONE)
   It's running on the Jenkinsfile.

## Task 5. Remote stage test - ***Optional*** (FAIL)
   - Enable remote test for the `greet` api from Jenkinsfile stage

I made a few changes and tests. The port forward script is not openning the 8080 server port.
With the changes I made sometimes it worked but sometimes it doesn't so I consider no completed.

## Task 6. SMTP - ***Optional*** (DONE/TESTED)
   - Enable smtp mailing for post stage

   Had to install the e-mail extension plugin.
   Configure the notifications tab on Jenkins Configuration.
   Used my gmail account to test and make it work.
